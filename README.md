# builtins.mango

This repository contains scripts that constitute the built-in commands for the [Mango CLI tool](https://github.com/RayZh-hs/Mango). it is updated and maintained alongside the Mango CLI tool itself.

## Updating Built-in Commands

Check your mango cli's version with:

```bash
mango --version
```

If it is older than `2.0.0`, you will need to re-install Mango using the instructions specified in the [Mango Repo](https://github.com/RayZh-hs/Mango). If it is `2.0.0` or newer, you can update the built-in commands like any other Mango submodule:

```bash
cd ~ && mango @submodule update builtins
```
